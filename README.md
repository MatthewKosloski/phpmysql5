I've used PHP and MySQL for years with WordPress theme development; however, I never sat down to actually learn beyond the basics of PHP and MySQL.  This is due to the fact that WordPress themes only use a minimum amount of PHP and it is fairly straight forward.  All code examples are from [PHP and MySQL for Dynamic Web Sites: Visual QuickPro Guide (5th Edition)](https://www.amazon.com/PHP-MySQL-Dynamic-Web-Sites/dp/0134301846/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8) by Larry Ullman.
